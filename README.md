# Degas
DGA-generated domain detection using deep learning models



## Why "Degas"? 
 * Because it's more fun working on a project with a name, rather than "DGA-detector" or something. 
 * Perhaps naming the project after an impressionist painter will make it sound more impressive?
 * It was the first result from the classic "Samba naming algorithm" ( `egrep -i '^d.*g.*a.* /usr/share/dict/words` )

For the record, I'm pronouncing it "de-gah", as in [Edgar Degas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Degas), not "de-gas", as in "to remove all the gas."
